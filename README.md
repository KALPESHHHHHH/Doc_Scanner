# Doc_Scanner
he document scanner first cleans up the image by reducing any unwanted noise, then identifies the edges of the document. It extracts the shapes from the image and selects the one that most closely resembles the document's outline. Finally, it adjusts the perspective to display the document as if viewed from above, creating a clear, readable image.
